# Controller

This project is a microcontroller implementation of a new algorithm for power inversion
using a switched differential inclusion to steer an output voltage trajectory to within some neighborhood around a reference signal. This neighborhood is known as the tracking band.

This project aims to address the following issues:
  - Implement the control law on a Ti Piccolo
  - Assess the performance of the hybrid algorithm compared to PWM, or bang-bang techniques
  - Interface with a boost circuit
  - MPPT
  - Battery Charging


>The purpose of this project is to design and build a prototype to implement a control algorithm to invert mildly varying DC input power obtained from renewable sources into AC power to feed standard loads.
